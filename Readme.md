# Overview

## Objectives

1. Ability to create almost any physical simulation (2D)
2. Nice and easy to use interface
3. Clean and understandable documentation

## TODO
- [x] Create 2D `Vector` class with basic methods
- [ ] Move unit tests to kotlin tests or JUnit
- [ ] Create REPL which will be later replaced by gui 
- [ ] Create `Space / Environment` classes which will be the main scene of the simulation. Environment will enable adding
extra conditions like air resistance or gravity as well as void / air / water. 
- [ ] Implement basic kinematics formulas for `Points`
- [ ] Test Kinematics
